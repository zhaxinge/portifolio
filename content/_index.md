- description: Out of interest in the landscape theory and the academic framework, I have read a sea of literature on such theories as landscape urbanism. I believe the landscape should build a complete ecological framework for cities, rather than being spaces in the literal sense, and should guide urban/regional development. Over the past four-year study, my design approach has  transformed from solely form-driven narratives to enage deeper inquiry through research, particularly that of <span class="default-text bold-text">adaptive design.</span>    In the future, I hope to stimulate the potential of data science in environmental design and planning decisions, and to explore the boundaries of urban ecological frameworks.
